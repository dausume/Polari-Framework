    Every row says which ASSUMPTION it breaks, what you would OBSERVE, which remedies (Techniques) restore the
    assumption, and where its rate comes from (a citation, a measured run, or `unverified` — never a silent guess).
    Related concepts: `FirmwareFault`, `Assumption`, `Technique`, `Scenario`.
