@module cmod.cmod_seed

THE ATOMS AS ROWS (C_MODULARIZATION_PLAN.md §2): every TEMPLATE project's committed `polari-firmware.json` (the UNO:
board/custom/firmware/uno/polari-firmware.json) projected into CProject / CModule / CFunctionAtom / CPort rows by
custom/rows.py. The manifest is derived and committed, so a boot needs no parse and no engine; the rows are code-owned
(re-seed → they follow the manifest) except the hand-set `title` / `notes`, which stay as the instance has them. CGraph
has no seeds (cmod-1).
